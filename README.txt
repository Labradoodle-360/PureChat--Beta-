To get started, create a database for your PC install. Then open ~/Includes/db_info.php and edit the information therein. Next, open the SQL file, select your PC database in PHPMyAdmin, open a query window and copy the paste the contents of the SQL file into it.

Open the PC in a browser, and if there are no errors, you did it right!

Thanks for looking,
